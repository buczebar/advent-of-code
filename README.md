[^aoc]: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
